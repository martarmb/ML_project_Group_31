# Machine Learning Project for Master Degree Program in Data Science and Advanced Analytics from NOVA IMS

## TO GRANT OR NOT TO GRANT: DECIDING ON COMPENSATION BENEFITS
The New York Workersâ€™ Compensation Board (WCB) oversees and regulates benefits for workers' compensation, disability, and various volunteer services, ensuring proper handling of workplace injury claims. Since 2000, the WCB has processed over 5 million claims. To simplify operations and improve efficiency, the WCB aims to develop a predictive model that automates decision-making whenever a new claim is received.
