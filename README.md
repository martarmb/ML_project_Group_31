# Machine Learning Project for Master Degree Program in Data Science and Advanced Analytics from NOVA IMS - Group 31

## TO GRANT OR NOT TO GRANT: DECIDING ON COMPENSATION BENEFITS
The New York Workersâ€™ Compensation Board (WCB) oversees and regulates benefits for workers' compensation, disability, and various volunteer services, ensuring proper handling of workplace injury claims. Since 2000, the WCB has processed over 5 million claims. To simplify operations and improve efficiency, the WCB aims to develop a predictive model that automates decision-making whenever a new claim is received.

#### The project is divided into two Jupyter Notebooks. The first one contains data preprocessing and concludes with saving the datasets in CSV file format (Group_31_NOTEBOOK), while the second one focuses on model testing (Group_31_part2_modeling).
#### In addition to the main project, there is a separate Jupyter Notebook dedicated to preprocessing the "Agreement Reached" variable (Preprocessing for Agreement Reached), as well as another Jupyter Notebook focused on testing models for this variable (Agreement Reached Predictions).
#### Three PDFs have been included in the repository to show the outputs of the undersampling, oversampling, and regular datasets. They are names as following: OversamplingOutput.pdf, UndersamplingOutput.pdf, and RegularOutput.pdf
