1.	Defining ID as the index
2.	Checking the target variable
3.	Describing the dataset 
4.	Defining datasets that contains numeric and categoric variables
5.	Defining independent variables and the dependent variable
6.	Ploting historgrams (Margarida) and multivariate analysis (Victoria)
7.	Checking unique values/changing strange values into NaN -> Julia
8.	Splitting the dataset into train and validation -> Julia 
9.	Checking for missing values/ filling missing values -> Julia
(age at injury (explore 0 values) and birth year (aggregating with accident date) 

10.	 Checking the outliers and dealing with them  -> Eduardo

11.	Creating variables like days between etc. - Victoria
12.	Encoding and Normalize the numeric data (using MinMaxScaler) -> Marta
13.	 Scale the data ->  Marta
14.	Feature selection: 
-	correlations (X_train, X_val)  - Victoria
-	filter methods â€“ Margarida
-	wrapper methods - Eduardo
-	embedded methods  - Eduardo

Project handout:

1. Import the dataset and explore the data (3 points)
Check data contents, provide descriptive statistics and check for incoherencies in the
data.
Explore data visually and extract relevant insights. Explain your rationale and
findings. Do not forget to analyse multivariate relationships.
2. Clean and pre-process the dataset (5 points)
Are there any missing values? Take action to handle them.
Check the dataset for outliers and pre-process them. Justify your decisions.
Deal with categorical variables.
Review current features and create extra features if needed. Explain your steps.
Perform data scaling. Explain the reasoning behind your choices.
3. Feature selection (3 points)
Define and implement an unambiguous strategy for feature selection. Use methods
discussed in the course. Present and justify your final selection.
4. Build a simple model and assess the performance (4 points)
Identify the type of the problem and select the relevant algorithms.
Use cross-validation to assess performance. Which metrics did you use and why?
